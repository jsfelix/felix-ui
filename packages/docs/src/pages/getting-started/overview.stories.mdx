# Felix UI - Overview

Felix UI is a React Design System that uses TailwindCSS to
create beautiful components.

## Introduction

Felix UI is an open-source React Design System Library that uses
TailwindCSS and Radix UI to create beautiful, reusable, accessible and
server/client side components for your application.

Advantages of using Felix UI:

- component standardization;
- easy to use in your application;
- because Felix UI uses TailwindCSS for styles, there is no runtime
  CSS, and the library is compatible with React v18 and server side
  components;
- you may extend TailwindCSS and the default theme configuration in
  your app, if you want to use Tailwind; in other hands, you don't need to
  install and use TailwindCSS.

An example of `Button` component:

<Source
  language="tsx"
  dark
  code={`
import { Button } from '@felix-ui/react'

export function App() {
  return (
    <div className="p-4 border rounded-md">
      <Button onClick={() => console.log('sent!')}>
        Send report
      </Button>
    </div>
  )
}`}
/>

<Button onClick={() => console.log('sent!')}>Send report</Button>
